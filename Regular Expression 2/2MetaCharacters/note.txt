Meta characters

Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:

All meta characters: . ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
Meta characters need need to be escaped (with ) if we actually want to search for the char.

. Any character (except newline character) "he..o"
^ Starts with "^hello"
$ Ends with "world$"
* Zero or more occurrences "aix*"
+ One or more occurrences "aix+"
{ } Exactly the specified number of occurrences "al{2}"
[] A set of characters "[a-m]"
\ Signals a special sequence (can also be used to escape special characters) "\d"
| Either or "falls|stays"
( ) Capture and group
